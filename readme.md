It's a book written a long time ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mythicalmanmonth00fred" target="_blank">It's so important that it is available for **FREE** online!</a>

Whenever I've spoken with developers I've admired or respected I ask them about what books they've read regarding development.  Without fail, "The Mythical Man Month" is somewhere in the response.  

You probably got a taste of how good the book is in the first chapter.  Tonight, you will each be reading a different chapter in TMMM.  Much like last night you will be forking this repo and submitting answers when you are finished.
